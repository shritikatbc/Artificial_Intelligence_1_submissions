    "# Workbook 9: Building Your First Chatbot with AIML\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will create a knowledge-base for an expert system and embed that into a simple chat-bot using the AIML knowledge representation language.\n",
    "    - First you will learn how knowledge is stored in AIML within `<category>` tags. With inputs `<pattern>` and outputs `<template>` tags.\n",
    "    - Then we will create a knowledge-base of 12 questions and answers about knowledge-based systems to form an 'FAQ'.\n",
    "        - We'll do this by creating a new `<category>` for each question and answer.\n",
    "        - This help you learn how preprocessing is applied to text before it reaches the AIML interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second part of this workbook will introduce simple forward chaining with `<srai>` tags.\n",
    "    - SRAI (Symbolic Reduction) allows the bot to respond in the same way to different ways of phrasing the same input.\n",
    "    - We'll demonstrate this by using `<srai>` tag-pairs to respond to different greetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third part of the workbook will start creating the AIML knowledge-base for the final part of the assessed portfolio.\n",
    "    - The 12 question and answer categories will be part of this knowlege-base (the final submission will require 45 total).\n",
    "    - You can begin adapting the AIML to use `<srai>` tag-pairs to allow the bot to respond to different ways of asking the same question.\n",
    "\n",

    " - [Pandorabots AIML reference - for syntax](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-reference/)\n",

    " - [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/aiml/index.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Remember:</b>\n",
    "Because it is much more lightweight, in class we are using the python-aiml package. This is only AIML v1 compliant, and  <em>does not</em> support all the features of AIML v2.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running the notebooks on the cloud server you need to click on the kernel menu and then change-kernel to'AIenv'.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running locally AND you created a virtual environment in Jupyter click on the kernel menu then change-kernel OR in VSCode use the kernel selector in the top-right hand corner.</p>\n",
